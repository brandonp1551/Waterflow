# Waterflow

The goal of this project is to read in topographic data from a file, create an internal 3D representation of it, and simulate a flood event.

The user should select where the flood begins and how much water is released in it.

The program should, with some level of realism, display the water as it flows through the environment. Please see the wiki for more precise details on its implementation.

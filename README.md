# Waterflow

The goal of this project is to read in topographic data from a file, create an internal 3D representation of it, and simulate a flood event.

The user should select where the flood begins and how much water is released in it.

The program should, with some level of realism, display the water as it flows through the environment. Please see the wiki for more precise details on its implementation.

# GitHub Usage

Always work in your own branch for whatever adds or fixes you're working on. Keep unrelated branches separate. If you want to make changes to how getOptions() works and how Display picks its colors, those should probably go into two different branches. This makes merging code back into master easier and less likelyl to have code conflicts.

Always assign an issue to yourself before you work on it, if the issue doesn't exist, make it. That way we never have two people working on the same issue without realizing it.

Do your best to update the documentation in the wiki about how our code does what it does. We'll be thankful as the code base grows that we have in writing what some of this stuff is supposed to be doing.
